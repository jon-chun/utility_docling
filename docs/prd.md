## Executive Summary

### Vision Statement
Create a production-grade, automated document conversion pipeline that enables AI researchers, data engineers, and documentation teams to reliably convert large batches of documents between formats while maintaining complete data integrity, audit trails, and operational safety.

### Problem Statement
Organizations processing large document collections face several critical challenges:

1. **Data Loss Risk**: Manual file management leads to lost or overwritten files
2. **Naming Collisions**: Converting files with identical names causes silent overwrites
3. **No Audit Trail**: Lack of conversion history and error tracking
4. **Manual Workflow**: Time-consuming manual file organization and tracking
5. **Error Recovery**: No systematic retry or error handling for failed conversions
6. **Structure Loss**: Nested directory hierarchies are flattened during conversion

### Solution Overview
A Python-based automated pipeline system featuring:
- Three-tier rotation system (queue → staging → processing)
- Collision-safe filename generation with source tracking
- Recursive processing with directory structure preservation
- Comprehensive error handling with automatic retry
- Timestamped archives and detailed audit logs
- YAML configuration with CLI overrides
- Dry-run mode for safe testing

### Success Metrics
- **Reliability**: 99.9% successful conversion rate for valid documents
- **Safety**: Zero data loss through automated archiving
- **Traceability**: 100% of conversions logged with timestamps
- **Usability**: <5 minute setup time for new users
- **Performance**: Process 1000 documents/hour on standard hardware

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: File Discovery and Filtering

**Priority**: P0 (Must Have)  
**User Story**: As a user, I need the system to automatically find and process only relevant file types so that I don't manually filter thousands of files.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- GIVEN a directory with mixed file types
- WHEN I configure input_types = ['pdf', 'docx']
- THEN only PDF and DOCX files are processed
- AND files are discovered recursively in all subdirectories
- AND discovery is case-insensitive (.PDF = .pdf)
- AND files are processed in deterministic order (alphabetically)

**Implementation Details**:
```python
def list_input_files(input_dir: str, allowed_types: List[str]) -> List[Tuple[str, str]]:
    # Returns: [(absolute_path, relative_path), ...]
    # Recursive: walks entire tree
    # Filtering: extension matching against allowed_types
    # Ordering: sorted by relative path
```

**Test Cases**:
- ✓ Process only PDFs when input_types=['pdf']
- ✓ Process multiple types when input_types=['pdf','docx']
- ✓ Skip files without extensions
- ✓ Handle nested directories up to 10 levels deep
- ✓ Process 1000+ files without memory issues

### FR-2: Three-Tier Rotation System

**Priority**: P0 (Must Have)  
**User Story**: As a user, I need files to automatically flow through queue → staging → processing so that I can organize batches without manual file management.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- GIVEN files in inputs_queue/, inputs_staging/, and inputs/
- WHEN conversion completes
- THEN inputs/ files move to inputs_old_{timestamp}/
- AND inputs_staging/ files move to inputs/
- AND inputs_queue/ files move to inputs_staging/
- AND all original files are preserved in archives

**Rotation Sequence**:
```
Before Run N:
  inputs_queue/    [C.pdf]
  inputs_staging/  [B.pdf]
  inputs/          [A.pdf]

During Run N:
  Process A.pdf → outputs/A_from_pdf.md

After Run N (Rotation):
  inputs_queue/    []           # Moved to staging
  inputs_staging/  [C.pdf]      # From queue
  inputs/          [B.pdf]      # From staging
  inputs_old_N/    [A.pdf]      # Archived after processing
```

**Edge Cases**:
- Empty directories (handled gracefully)
- Large files (moved efficiently)
- Symbolic links (followed correctly)
- Permissions issues (logged with error)

**Test Cases**:
- ✓ Single file flows through 3 tiers correctly
- ✓ Multiple files maintain order
- ✓ Empty directories don't cause errors
- ✓ Rotation creates unique timestamp directories
- ✓ No data loss during rotation failures

### FR-3: Collision-Safe Naming

**Priority**: P0 (Must Have)  
**User Story**: As a user, I need files with the same name but different formats to not overwrite each other so that I don't lose data.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- GIVEN report.pdf and report.docx in inputs/
- WHEN converting both to Markdown
- THEN report.pdf → report_from_pdf.md
- AND report.docx → report_from_docx.md
- AND both files coexist without collision

**Naming Convention**:
```
Pattern: {original_name}_from_{input_ext}.{output_ext}

Examples:
  analysis.pdf    → analysis_from_pdf.md
  analysis.docx   → analysis_from_docx.md
  2024_report.pdf → 2024_report_from_pdf.html
```

**Test Cases**:
- ✓ Handle files with same basename, different extensions
- ✓ Preserve special characters in filenames
- ✓ Handle long filenames (>255 chars)
- ✓ Support Unicode filenames
- ✓ Handle filenames with dots (report.v2.pdf)

### FR-4: Directory Structure Preservation

**Priority**: P0 (Must Have)  
**User Story**: As a documentation manager, I need the output directory to mirror my input folder structure so that I maintain organizational hierarchy.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- GIVEN nested input structure: inputs/dept_a/project_x/doc.pdf
- WHEN converting to Markdown
- THEN output mirrors structure: outputs/dept_a/project_x/doc_from_pdf.md
- AND empty intermediate directories are created
- AND directory permissions are preserved

**Example**:
```
inputs/
├── research/
│   ├── 2024/
│   │   └── paper_001.pdf
│   └── 2025/
│       └── paper_002.pdf
└── internal/
    └── memo.pdf

outputs/
├── research/
│   ├── 2024/
│   │   └── paper_001_from_pdf.md
│   └── 2025/
│       └── paper_002_from_pdf.md
└── internal/
    └── memo_from_pdf.md
```

**Test Cases**:
- ✓ Mirror structure up to 10 levels deep
- ✓ Create missing intermediate directories
- ✓ Handle spaces in directory names
- ✓ Handle Unicode directory names
- ✓ Preserve relative paths correctly

### FR-5: Configuration Management

**Priority**: P0 (Must Have)  
**User Story**: As a data engineer, I need YAML-based configuration with CLI overrides so that I can manage different environments (dev/staging/prod).

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- GIVEN a config.yaml file with settings
- WHEN I run the script
- THEN configuration is loaded from YAML
- AND CLI arguments override YAML settings
- AND missing config falls back to defaults
- AND invalid config shows clear error messages

**Configuration Schema**:
```yaml
input_types: [pdf, docx, txt, md, html]
output_types: [pdf, docx, txt, md, html]
max_file_size_mb: 100
retry_attempts: 2
retry_delay_seconds: 1.0
directories:
  inputs: ./inputs
  outputs: ./outputs
  inputs_queue: ./inputs_queue
  inputs_staging: ./inputs_staging
```

**CLI Override Examples**:
```bash
python script.py --inputs /custom/inputs
python script.py --config prod.yaml --log-level DEBUG
python script.py --outputs /mnt/shared --dry-run
```

**Test Cases**:
- ✓ Load valid YAML configuration
- ✓ Reject invalid YAML with clear error
- ✓ CLI overrides YAML settings
- ✓ Missing config uses defaults
- ✓ Validate config before processing

### FR-6: Error Handling and Retry

**Priority**: P0 (Must Have)  
**User Story**: As a user, I need automatic retry for failed conversions so that transient errors don't require manual intervention.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- GIVEN a conversion that fails due to transient error
- WHEN retry_attempts = 2
- THEN system retries 2 additional times (3 total attempts)
- AND waits retry_delay_seconds between attempts
- AND logs each attempt with details
- AND reports final failure if all attempts fail

**Retry Logic**:
```python
for attempt in range(retry_attempts + 1):
    try:
        result = convert_document(file)
        if success:
            return success
    except Exception as e:
        if attempt < retry_attempts:
            log.warning(f"Attempt {attempt+1} failed, retrying...")
            time.sleep(retry_delay)
        else:
            log.error(f"All {retry_attempts+1} attempts failed")
            return failure
```

**Error Categories**:
1. **Retriable**: Network timeouts, temporary file locks
2. **Non-retriable**: Corrupt files, unsupported formats
3. **Fatal**: Configuration errors, missing directories

**Test Cases**:
- ✓ Retry transient errors up to configured limit
- ✓ Don't retry fatal errors
- ✓ Log each retry attempt
- ✓ Report final status in run report
- ✓ Continue processing other files after failure

### FR-7: Progress Reporting and Statistics

**Priority**: P1 (Should Have)  
**User Story**: As a user, I need real-time progress updates so that I know how long processing will take for large batches.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- GIVEN 100 files to process
- WHEN conversion runs
- THEN show progress: [45/100 - 45.0%] Processing: file.pdf
- AND show estimated time remaining (if possible)
- AND show conversion speed (files/sec or MB/sec)
- AND display final statistics summary

**Progress Format**:
```
[1/100 - 1.0%] Processing: document_001.pdf
  Converting to md: document_001_from_pdf.md
  ✓ Success: ./outputs/document_001_from_pdf.md (2.3s)

...

[100/100 - 100.0%] Processing: document_100.pdf
  ✓ Success: ./outputs/document_100_from_pdf.md (1.8s)

======================================================================
CONVERSION STATISTICS
======================================================================
Total files discovered: 100
Successful conversions: 98
Failed conversions: 2
Skipped (same type): 5
Total data processed: 456.7MB
Total runtime: 8m 34s
Average speed: 0.89 MB/s
======================================================================
```

**Test Cases**:
- ✓ Display progress for 1000+ files
- ✓ Update progress in real-time
- ✓ Calculate statistics correctly
- ✓ Format human-readable sizes (MB, GB)
- ✓ Format human-readable durations (5m 34s)

### FR-8: Dry-Run Mode

**Priority**: P1 (Should Have)  
**User Story**: As a user, I need dry-run mode so that I can preview operations before executing them on important data.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- GIVEN --dry-run flag
- WHEN script runs
- THEN show what would be converted
- AND show where files would be written
- AND show rotation that would occur
- BUT don't actually convert or move any files
- AND mark all output with [DRY RUN] prefix

**Dry-Run Output Example**:
```
======================================================================
MODE: DRY RUN (no actual conversions will be performed)
======================================================================

[1/5 - 20.0%] Processing: document.pdf
  [DRY RUN] Would convert to md: document_from_pdf.md
  [DRY RUN] Would create: ./outputs/document_from_pdf.md

...

[DRY RUN] Rotation would occur:
  ./inputs/ → ./inputs_old_20250930_160000_000
  ./inputs_staging/ → ./inputs/
  ./inputs_queue/ → ./inputs_staging/
```

**Test Cases**:
- ✓ No files created in dry-run mode
- ✓ No directories modified in dry-run mode
- ✓ All operations logged with [DRY RUN] prefix
- ✓ Exit code indicates what would happen
- ✓ Statistics show projected results

### FR-9: Atomic Operations

**Priority**: P0 (Must Have)  
**User Story**: As a user, I need crash-safe file writes so that power failures or crashes don't corrupt output files.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- GIVEN a conversion in progress
- WHEN a crash occurs mid-write
- THEN incomplete files are automatically cleaned up
- AND previously completed files remain intact
- AND next run can retry failed conversions

**Atomic Write Implementation**:
```python
def atomic_write(path, content):
    tmp_path = f"{path}.tmp"
    try:
        write(tmp_path, content)
        os.replace(tmp_path, path)  # Atomic on most systems
    except:
        if exists(tmp_path):
            remove(tmp_path)  # Cleanup
        raise
```

**Test Cases**:
- ✓ Simulate crash during write
- ✓ Verify temp files cleaned up
- ✓ Verify completed files intact
- ✓ Retry succeeds after crash
- ✓ No partial files in outputs/

### FR-10: Run Reports and Audit Logs

**Priority**: P1 (Should Have)  
**User Story**: As a compliance officer, I need detailed audit logs of all conversions so that I can track document processing history.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- GIVEN a conversion run
- WHEN processing completes
- THEN generate timestamped report: run_report_{timestamp}.txt
- AND include configuration used
- AND list all files processed with results
- AND include statistics and runtime
- AND include failed files with error reasons
